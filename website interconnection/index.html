                Five-star hotels are properties that offer their guests the highest levels of luxury through personalized services, a vast range of amenities, and sophisticated accommodations. Though there is no standard rating system for hotels, properties earn 5-star distinction by providing guests experiences that meet or exceed even the highest of expectations for comfort, décor, and luxury.
            Some luxury hotels are even trying to out-do others to prove that they have 5-star amenities and are above and beyond the competition. These go far past the typical luxury upgrades. 
One example from Bloomberg Businessweek describes foraging in the woods for parts of your meal (Five-Star Mushroom Hunting Programs Are Newest Amenity at Top Hotels). Other's include in-room drink stations for cocktails or guest-use of boat or yacht (Gili Lankanfushi guests can access a 14-metre Riviera yacht). A hotel in Northern California Will Fill Your Room With Fresh Flowers and Houseplants — That You Can Take Home". Travel+Leisure also found this hotel in the Belize that will puts cocooning butterflies in rooms for guests to release.
During COVID-19 lock-downs, some 5-Star resorts even transformed themselves into full-service family getaways offering "work-from-home" office spaces, full time childcare (including camps and even schooling), and pet concierges. One examples is from back in 2020 when Island Destinations properties did private family camp getaways.
